I'm Alisa Wilhelm. I'm a software engineer from Chile, though I recently moved to Israel.
Currently I'm unemployed due to the move, but I try to keep myself busy because I love learning, and there is always more to learn and dive deeper.

This blog is my personal space to talk about what I'm working on or interests me. Right now that means systems programming and deepening knowledge about how things work at a low level. That being said, my interests in tech are varied so I'm sure I will end up writing posts on different topics here.

This blog exists mostly because I often want to put my thoughts or observations somewhere, and I dont enjoy social media. So I decided to set up this little site for myself. This way feels more personal and more *me*.
